# Machine-Learning-Driven-Tests-for-Predicting-Cancer-Recurrence-Risk

I developed a machine learning classifier to predict the risk of recurrence in early-stage hormone receptor-positive breast cancer patients. The project involved comprehensive data analysis and predictive modeling.

Key data analysis techniques, including multivariate analysis, box plots, and density plots, were used to extract meaningful insights from the dataset. Data preprocessing steps, such as handling missing values, one-hot encoding, and normalization, ensured the dataset was prepared for accurate modeling. To address class imbalance, the Random Over Sampler technique was applied to improve model performance.

For predictive modeling, ensemble techniques like bagging and boosting were employed, enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the predictions. The PyCaret library was utilized for model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning, leading to the identification of the best-performing models. The model's effectiveness was assessed using the Area Under the Curve (AUC) metric.
